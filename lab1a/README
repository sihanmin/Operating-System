    In order to fully understand a terminal, I read "The GNU C Library" Chapter
17. In particular, I found 17.7 "Noncanonical Mode Example" very helpful in
building my own noncanonical mode terminal. Also, I read the manual page for
functions like fork(2), exec(3), pipe(2), and poll(2) to ensure correct usage.
